# Masters-Project-work

This repositary contains the major componenets of my masters project work.
The first objective of my thesis project explored how spatial and temporal scales impact the regionalization of extreme rainfall in India. The second objective was to assess the effect of non-stationarity in hourly rainfall data on quantile estimates of extreme rainfall corresponding to a specific non-exceedance probability by comparing them with quantile estimates obtained from their stationary counterpart. The third objective was to estimate flood (peak flow) at a typical dam catchment in the frequent flood-prone Mahanadi basin using the quantile estimates obtained from non-stationary regional frequency analysis. The theories that I used in my project were: Estimation of L-moments and L-moment ratios, fuzzy clustering algorithm like the Competitive Agglomeration algorithm, Monte-Carlo Simulations, Hosking heterogeneity test, augmented Dicky Fuller test, regional frequency analysis and goodness of fit test, non-stationary quantile estimate, catchment delineation, and rainfall-runoff model. I used MATLAB, R, and Python extensively for big data analysis and statistical modeling in this project.
